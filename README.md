# Express Note Taker

## Description

This Employee Tracker is created using mySQL. The user can compile a list of employees, managers, and departments with their respective information, and the information will be saved into a database so the user can later edit the  information if need be.

In the future, I would like to try and strive towards cleaner code, as Javascript brackets and parentheses can become quite messy.

Building this program has taught me much more about shifting into the back end of web development, taking one step closer to full-stack web development as I work on my mySQL skills.

## Usage
Run "npm i" in your terminal, and once it has finished installing, run "node tracker.js"

You may then insert as much or as little information about your manager, employee, and/or department, with the opportunity to later edit the information as well.

When you are finished, simply select the "QUIT" option.
